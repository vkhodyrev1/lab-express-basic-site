            <p>Kathmandu,[a] officially the Kathmandu Metropolitan City,[b] is the capital and the 
                most populous city of Nepal with 845,767 inhabitants living in 105,649 households in 
                2021[1] and 2.9 million people in its urban agglomeration. It is located in the Kathmandu

                metres (4,600 feet).
                The city is one of the oldest continuously inhabited places in the world, 
                founded in 2nd century CE. The valley was historically called the "Nepal Mandala" 
                and has been the home of the Newar people, a cosmopolitan urban civilization in the 
                Himalayan foothills. The city was the royal capital of the Kingdom of Nepal and hosts 
                palaces, mansions, and gardens of the Nepalese aristocracy. It has been home to the 
                headquarters of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) since 1985. 
                Today, it is the seat of government of the Nepalese republic, established in 2008, and 
                is part of the Bagmati Province.</p>
